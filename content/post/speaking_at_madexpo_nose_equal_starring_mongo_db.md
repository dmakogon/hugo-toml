The Mid Atlantic Developer Expo () is this week: June 27-29, at the Hampton Roads Convention Center in Hampton, VA. This year, I’m presenting an introduction to the “NoSQL” database craze (kinda sounds like “Nose Equal”). We’ll fire up a quite-popular NoSQL database, [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

If you’re attending the conference, feel free to stop by and learn a bit of MongoDB goodness! [My talk](http://madexpo.us/Sessions/361)

* Wednesday @ 11am
* Friday @ 8:30am
