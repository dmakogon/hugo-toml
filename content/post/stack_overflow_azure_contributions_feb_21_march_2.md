Many people have asked me about programming resources, and where to get help on specific topics. I've been pointing them to as a great resource to get help, as it's community driven, with thousands of people participating. Additionally, it's a great place to contribute to the programming community and provide answers to others. 

I also contribute to StackOverflow, and thought it might be helpful to surface some of the questions I've been posting answers to, primarily regarding Windows Azure. So here goes: The first of (hopefully) many weekly summary posts. This one covers February 21 - March 2\. A bit more than a week, but who's counting... :)
