I'm excited to announce my upcoming talk at : **Building Hybrid MongoDB Apps on Windows Azure**! I'll be co-presenting with  from MS Open Tech. 

Full session abstract: 

> B_etween IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, Windows Azure has a veritable cornucopia of services and features to help architect hybrid apps. In this session, we'll show a multi-tier twitter-tracking node.js app pushing MongoDB data to Azure Web Sites using WebSockets, with PHP and ASP.NET clients for the Web and the desktop. You'll see how this can be easily done with Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, stateless Cloud Services, and Web Sites._

This is a fun talk with a cool demo app!
