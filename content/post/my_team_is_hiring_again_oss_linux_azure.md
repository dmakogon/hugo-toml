Our little Windows Azure architecture team is growing again! This time, we’re looking for someone with lots of Linux experience, coupled with non-.net development. We’re working with some cool ISVs worldwide, where the story is all about Azure + Linux. Don’t get too worried if Azure isn’t your primary cloud background.

This doesn’t stop at cloud or language knowledge. If you have some NoSQL experience, this is a big plus. Same goes with Big Data.

There’s some travel involved, including international travel.

The job posting is up on StackOverflow Careers, right [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/23621/oss-cloud-architect-microsoft?a=rUiblkc)

Any questions? Just post a comment here…
