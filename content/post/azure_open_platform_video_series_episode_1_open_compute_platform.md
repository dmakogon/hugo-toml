Last year, my coworker and I visited several cities worldwide, delivering an all-day **Windows Azure Open Platform Summit.** This one-day event covered compute+networking, data, and the developer story from an open source perspective. This included several languages (.net, python, php, and node.js) as well as several NoSQL databases (Azure Table Storage, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j). 

A few months later, we decided to record a 6-part video series covering the highlights of these topics. Each episode runs about 15 minutes. The first two segments were just published, and I'll update this post as the rest of the series comes online.
