10gen is holding its annual conference this week in Silicon Valley, December 4\. I was originally scheduled to co-present a session at the event, along with and 10gen engineer [Sridhar Nanjundeswaran](https://twitter.com/snanjund)

But fear not! Doug and Sridhar are still giving the talk. This session, titled “The three aaS’s of MongoDB in Windows Azure,” will go over deploying MongoDB in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (Paas). And… there’s now a MongoDB Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering, directly integrated in the Windows Azure Store:

This session is at 11:30 PST. Doug and Sridhar will show and compare all three approaches. If you’re headed to MongoSV, please consider sitting in!
