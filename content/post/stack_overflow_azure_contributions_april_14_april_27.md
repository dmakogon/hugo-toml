This week's post combines two weeks of StackOverflow answers. Last week was a bit hectic, as I flew DC-->Seattle (team meetings) -->San Francisco (customer visits) -->Louisville (CodePaLOUsa conference) -->DC in 5 days, then scrambled to Northern Virginia to help out with the Global Windows Azure Bootcamp. That, along with painful airport delays due to the Air Traffic Control furloughs, kept my blogging to a minimum (read: zero).

* **Azure endpoint monitoring: memory usage** ([link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16234559/272109)

* **Windows Azure: What is the use of Internal IP addresses?** ([link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16121128/272109)
* **DTC is disabled on SQL Azure; how to enable it?** ([link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16106794/272109)
* **How hard is it to upgrade an Azure Virtual Machine?** (). This answer shows how to change VM size via PowerShell. I don't quite understand why the question was closed (aside from it not being a programming question), as it _does_ involve API calls (via PowerShell), and I _do_ [link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16059998/272109)
