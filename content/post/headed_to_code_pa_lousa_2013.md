If you're in Louisville, and you're a software developer, you're in for a treat, as kicks off tomorrow, April 25\. What is CodePaLOUsa, you ask? Well... it's Software Development Madness! And Thursday morning, I'll be boarding a flight directly into this madness. 

The pre-conference workshops are Thursday (which sadly I'll miss, since planes do not yet travel at light-speed). Then Friday morning, keynote speaker Richard Campbell (of .NET Rocks fame) kicks things off, followed by two days of awe-inspiring sessions! 

I'll be presenting a look at the : Node, Java, PHP and Python to be exact. This is a demo-heavy session, showing how consistent (and extensive) the various SDKs are (and available on github in case you want to tweak them). (hint: This is _the_ session to attend, right after the keynote. I promise to make at least one stupid pun you can chastise me about...). 

Of course, there's always the chance (however small) that you actually want to see _other_ speakers present stuff. In that case, peruse the illustrious and see what a great line-up you have to choose from!
