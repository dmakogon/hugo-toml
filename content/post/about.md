I’ve been working with software since the IBM PC was unveiled, and have worked with Azure since its announcement.

I currently work for Microsoft, and I hold the dubious honor of being the world’s first *former* Windows Azure MVP.

When I’m not behind a computer monitor, I’m shooting photos, mountain-biking, or spending time with the family (and those aren't mutually exclusive). I also live and die by the pun.
