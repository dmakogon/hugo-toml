It's amazing how quickly time flies when traveling! Time for another StackOverflow recap post. This one covers my answers posted in the past 3 weeks, representing my time away in Israel, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, and... a bit of vacation time in the Outer Banks, North Carolina. 

While I also post several comments on StackOverflow, I figured they might not be as interesting to call out individually. If you're interested, they can all be viewed .
