I had the honor of presenting a session during the 2016 [Global Azure Bootcamp](http://global.azurebootcamp.net), a worldwide event held in 162 confirmed locations. The individual events at each location are typically run by Microsoft MVPs and community leaders.

This year, I gave a talk in Redmond, on the Microsoft campus. Coincidentally, the event took place in the same building my team works out of. This event was run by Manesh Raveendran, a Microsoft Azure MVP. Feel free to say hi to Manesh on Twitter at [@ManeshRavendran](https://twitter.com/ManeshRavendran/).

About 30-40 attendees participated, and we had a content-packed agenda, along with afternoon hands-on labs.

For my session, I spoke about the concept of *polyglot persistence*, the idea of using multiple databases within an app, taking advantage of each database's core strengths. This talk included overviews and demos of each core non-relational database type: key/value, document, column, and graph.

The demos took advantage of Azure's database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings, such as Table Storage, Redis, and DocumentDB. I also demo'd DataStax Cassandra, as this is a certified offering in the Azure Marketplace which rolls out an entire Cassandra cluster automatically. For the graph database, I demo'd with Neo4j in a VM, but also showed two hosting partners ([Graph Story](http://graphstory.com/) and [GrapheneDB](http://www.graphenedb.com/)). The talk wrapped up with a walkthrough of a hypothetical storefront, and we dreamed up best-fit suggestions for shopping cart, product descriptions, order history, product suggestions, and website logging/telemetry.

All of the talk materials are on my Github repo, [github.com/dmakogon/globalazure2016](https://github.com/dmakogon/globalazure2016).

A big THANK YOU to Manesh for offering a speaking slot, and to the super-awesome audience who didn't get stressed when I threw stress balls at them. And thanks to Andrew Liu ([@aliuy8](https://twitter.com/aliuy8)) of the DocumentDB engineering team, for letting me know about the event.

If you haven't been to a Global Azure Bootcamp before, I highly recommend them - same time, next year. And if one isn't in your area, feel free to step up and volunteer to organize one!
